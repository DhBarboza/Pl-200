### Question - 33:

A company uses a model-driven app. The app uses a workflow to send email. Emails are sent to new customers that enter an email address for the first time in the app. <br>
Customers report that they do not receive an email after entering an email address. <br>
You need to troubleshoot the issue. <br>
In which order should you perform the actions? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

![question-33](image-22.png)

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

1. Edit the workflow. Check if the workflow is set up correctly and it's set to be triggered when an email address is entered for the first time.
2. Run the workflow. Test the workflow manually to see if it functions as expected. Make sure you are testing with a new customer and a new email address as per the workflow trigger condition.
3. Review the tab with the process sessions. This is where you will find logs for each time the workflow has run. Look for any errors or warnings that might tell you why the workflow didn't run as expected.
4. Clear the option to delete the workflow retention jobs. This step may help in case the retention policy is causing the workflow history to be deleted before you can review it, but it's more of a preventive measure for future troubleshooting rather than something that will directly solve the current issue.
